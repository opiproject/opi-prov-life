# Use Cases

## Provisioning Models

**Network Peripheral**: Peripheral to the CPU exposing a network interface to the CPU OS, provisioned directly by the CPU OS.

**Data Processor Peripheral**: Peripheral to the CPU exposing a data processor (DPU) interface to the CPU OS, provisioned by the platform BMC.

**Infrastructure Device**: Independent device from the CPU exposing virtual devices to the CPU OS, provisioned by a trusted software entity over the network.

**Network Device**: Independent device provisioned by a trusted software entity over the network.

## Deployment scenarios

- Private network/cloud – (DHCP/DNS trusted)
               Telco Core
               Telco Near Edge
               Telco Far Edge
               Enterprise
               Industrial Edge (DPUs not currently prevalent)
- Colo – DHCP not trusted
- Other multitenant

## Usage scenarios

- Same org owns host and DPU
- Different org owns host and DPU, or uses host and DPU
- What are the needs/usages of third party OS and Apps on DPU?
- Pre-installed OS works in some scenarios, bare metal in others
- Pre-installed certificates
  - Signed by OEM, initially

## Discussion of sZTP branching into DHCP discovery and authentication of bootstrap server

- Openshift – installs on bare metal
- Scenarios for deployment
- UEFI has dhclient
- Linux has dhclient
- Some other entity handles discovery, like a BMC
- Call for Watsen SZTPD prototyping – no takers in this group; Intel may have agreed in Slack

## SKUs

- BMC vs no BMC on DPU; need to cover both scenarios
- Availability of ports – some will have management port, others not

## Usages

- Distributed firewall
- Virtual switch offloading
- Other networking services
- Storage offloads for composable systems
- NVMEoF
- …

## Derived requirements

- ZTP
               Agent running on DPU/CPU cores
               Installed by default – what are the mandatory default agents/apps/OS
               sZTP – when used?
               FDO – when used?
- Telemetry for service deployment
- Secure wipe? (reprovisioning)
               What does it erase
                              What memory devices
               Leave UEFI
                              What is present on a “bare metal” DPU

- Authenticating DHCP –
               List of MAC addresses (but could be spoofed)
               Perhaps better to use PKI to authenticate provision server specified in options
- Pre-provisioning step for provisioning server authentication
               Could be done at factory
               Reseller
               Integrator
               Telco (could be end owner)
- One method: first touch claims ownership (default credentials?)

## Notes

- Sonic community (there is precedent) – ZTP – the initial password is provisioned rather than default
- 802.1AR – device identity reference
- ONIE (precedent for provisioning/default OS) – small OS(linux) with ZTP client
- Other precedents – clients define installation
               PXE
               Boot from host (noted as less preferred)

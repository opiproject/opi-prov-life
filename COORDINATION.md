# Bootup coordination approaches

Reference [BOOTSEQ.md](./BOOTSEQ.md)

## TLDR

This page is taking assumptions and use cases from [BOOTSEQ.md](./BOOTSEQ.md) page and tries to deep dive on 3 possible solutions of the only initial bootup part.
Three possible solutions are either in-band via different PCIe mechanisms or option ROM (OROM) for UEFI / BIOS or OOB via BMC assisted mechanisms.
Initial bootup part covers: Server is Powered On, DPU receives power and starts booting, Host OS should wait for DPU to finish booting.

Coordinated shutdowns, reboots, crashes, error handling will be details on a separate page.

## 1: In-band PCIe

IB refers to PCIe config access to the xPU from UEFI running on the server cores.

1. All xPU devices shall have a standard PCI PF0 interface (PCI Physical Function 0) that is fully compliant to the PCIe specification
   - The PF0 interface shall be functional 3 seconds after PERST# is de-asserted
   - The PF0 interface shall be functional when the compute complex on the xPU is running, locked up or halted
2. Define a new PCI Class Code and corresponding PCI architected Extended Capability Structure for xPUs
   - Define PCI sub-classes for xPUs with and without an AMC
   - The PCI architected Extended Capability Structure shall include items 3-7 below
3. Define a read/write PF0 OS_BOOT_SELECT register with the following bits defined
   - Network OS boot (bit only - does not include the actual path and credentials)
   - OS on xPU’s non-volatile storage
   - UEFI on xPU’s non-volatile storage
   - Maintenance OS/FW on xPU’s non-volatile storage
   - Other
4. Define a read only PF0 OS_STATUS register with the following bits defined
   - Not started
   - Booting
   - Booted
   - Stalled or locked-up
   - Halted
5. Define a read only PF0 CRASHDUMP_STATUS register with the following bits defined
   - Not started
   - In progress
   - Complete
6. Define a read only PF0 MAX_BOOT_TIME register with a range from 0 to 1600 seconds
7. Define a read/write PF0 RESET register with individual bits to resets specific segments of the xPU
   - PCI interface
   - CPU complex
   - AMC
   - Accelerator1
   - Accelerator2
   - other

## 2: Driver Ready Check

The race condition to consider is when the Host is first to boot before the infrastrastructure is ready to serve to the Host its boot image (from a port or a disk hanging off the infrastructure device (DPU/IPU)).  To ensure that the port / disk is ready to be used by the Host, the driver running in the UEFI / BIOS should check that the infrastructure is ready before trying to PXE boot or to read the boot disk.
Infrastructure devices acting as either a Host peripheral or as an independent entity will benefit from this 'ready' check.

### Virtio-net

The virtio-net device presents its driver in an option ROM (OROM) for UEFI / BIOS.  This driver will stall the PXE boot process until the infrastructure backend is ready.

### Virtio-blk

The virtio-blk device presents its driver in an option ROM (OROM) for UEFI / BIOS.  This driver will stall the requests on the disk until the infrastructure backend is ready.

### NVMe

The NVMe device driver will poll the CSTS.rdy bit to ensure that infrastructure backend is ready before reading or writing.

## 3: Out-band via platform BMC
